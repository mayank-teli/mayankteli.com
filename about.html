                    <p> a second-year BCA student with a passion for coding and technology. I have hands-on experience
                        in several programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, C++, and Java. I enjoy creating
                        functional and visually appealing web applications, as well as exploring the latest trends in software
                        development.
                    </p>
                    <p>My goal is to continuously learn and grow, and I’m always excited to pick up new skills and work on 
                        challenging projects. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I’m eager to
                        collaborate and bring innovative ideas to life. Let's connect!
